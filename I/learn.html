        <p id="message1">Coming to the United States was a decision I made out of my pursuit of quality education and broadening my horizons. Pennâ€™s renowned academic excellence fueled my dream of attending Penn. One of the most memorable experiences and challenges I faced was overcoming the language barrier. However, I was lucky enough to have supportive roommates who were enthusiastic about helping me learn English, which made a big difference. I'm so impressed with the hospitality of everyone here. Despite the initial language difficulties, immersing myself in reading books and watching American television shows greatly improved my English. Building friendships through activities like basketball and joining clubs can be beneficial. These connections enriched my experience and made me feel more at home. I recommend those international students to come to the United States because it is an easy way to grow academically and to develop meaningful friendships. Here you can express yourself boldly.
